<p class="p1">Hi,</p>
<p class="p1">I'd like to submit you: an opensource application that would give institutions a real-time platform to monitor the symptoms of all citizens about coronavirus and create the <b>SYMPOTAMATIC MAP</b> in real time to anticipate the <b>covid19</b> (spread map is too late).</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>INTRODUCTION:</b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>NOW HERE IN ITALY WE ARE ALREADY IN SELF-QUARANTINE (AND WE WILL BE LONG) SO MAKE AVAILABLE TO GOVERNMENTS/OMS AND SCIENCE,</b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>ALL SYMPTOMATIC BIG DATA THROUGH INVOLVING ALL CITIZENS, IT WILL GUARANTEE MORE SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY,</b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>MORE CONTROL AND ACCURATE/TIMELY INTERVENTIONS AND ABOVE ALL LESS CONTACT AND RISK FOR OUR GENERAL PRACTIONERS AND HEALTH STAFF,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></b></p>
<p class="p3"><b>PROVIDING THE SYMPTOMATIC DATA OF THE POPULATION TO SCIENCE TO STUDY THE CORONA VIRUS FASTER<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>TO FIND TERAPY AND VACCINE.</b></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p2"><b></b><br></p>
<p class="p1"><b>PROPOSAL</b>:</p>
<p class="p1">An <b>opensource</b> application that would give institutions a real-time platform to monitor the symptoms of the Coronavirus.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Talking with doctors in Italy, emerged that it would be really beneficial to have the symptomatic map as soon as possible<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">(not so important the spread map: it's too late) to block new infections and intervene with the poorly available resources.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The application users will input only the symptoms they have (temperature, cough, etc.).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">According to such symptoms the authority will be able to decide if they need or not to be tested or when.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The main idea of the app is to have a symptomatic map so that authorities will be able to intervene at the right place and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">as soon as possible before the infection spreads and avoid the <b>COLLAPSE OF HEALTH STRUCTURES</b>.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Because of privacy limitations, probably the mandatory element would be finding government sponsorship</p>
<p class="p1">Government institutions &amp; Institutes of Health would be the only ones predisposed to manage / analyze data</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
